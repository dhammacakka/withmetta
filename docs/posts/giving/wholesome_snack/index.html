<h2 id="a-wholesome-snack">A wholesome snack</h2>
<p>It was an evening about 3 pm when we were on our way home. Me and my two sons. We have this small cafeteria close to our house and usually we stop by to pick up some snacks for tea in the evenings. My sons remained inside the rickshaw and I went inside the cafe. I saw this lady near the counter. I waited until she paid and I could see the staff behind the cashier whispering to each other. There were about 4 ladies along with the cashier. The customer walked past and as she was going she slowed down near the food on display. There was such longing inside her eyes. All the while when I ordered my stuff I continued to watch her. Her tea was brought and I was surprised because I was sure she was hungry. From the behaviour of the staff I could tell that she had no money to pay for food, probably she must have asked for some free food and got rejected and that she must be a very frequent “desperate” customer probably a nuisance by now.</p>
<p>I bought a chinese roll and went and gave it to her. She was a bit surprised and before she could say anything I smiled and said that it is from me and quickly went back to my place where I continued wait for my parcel. Her hands were shaking while she was eating. How hungry she must have been. “Will that be enough for her?” I asked myself. I went to her and asked. “Shall I bring another one ?” she didn’t even stop eating to speak to me and said with food in her mouth “If you can” very shyly, not meeting my eyes. So I gave her another one and all the while the staff very curiously were watching us.</p>
<p>This is a vegetarian cafe where I know the owner somewhat. She gives a lot of alms-giving to temples and does a lot of religious things and I was surprised to see when giving is not done when the needy comes and ask for it. Maybe she is not aware of it. I don’t know. But surely they can afford to share some free food to regular people who need it?
All the while when I went and walked to the car park she was watching me while she was eating. Smiling widely. I smiled back at her and when I got in my boys asked why face was so radiant. I told them what happened. They looked towards the cafe and saw her.  They told me that they have seen her always on that road and that she is always in the same dress.</p>
