# About
Originally, I wanted a place to post my Abhidhamma Articles, so I placed them in my Google Drive and made them public. However, as I updated the PDF, a new file link was created each time and I did not like that. I then asked a monastic senior friend if he would give me some space on his server so people could download my PDF. He agreed and made a redirected website called Subhuti.net.tf which is available without registration fees. This was sort of fun and worked well for a few months until ads started to pop up. Nothing provided by commercial companies are really for free. After some deliberation, I decided to get a real website.


When I decided to make a new website, I had the chance to choose a name unrelated to my own personal name, so I decided “WithMetta.net” would be a good name since “with metta” is how we Buddhists often sign our emails on the line above our names.  I never checked to see if “withlovingkindness” was available although it was my second choice. Metta means Loving-kindness in the ancient Theravada Buddhist Pāli Language.


After the website was registered and created, it seemed like I should do something related the name. Logically, posting stories about acts of kindness came to mind. While “Metta” is a keyword to know that it is related to Theravada, the selection of that word was based on having a website for my Theravada writings. Metta or Loving-kindness is universal and anyone can participate, write or read the stories.

I wish you well,
With Metta,
Bhante Subhūti

**Update:**  5 years later, 2019.  I have created a blog and that was called subhut.withmetta.net .   However, as I told people in America the name of my blog, I noticed a confused look on their faces.  Eventually, I decided to make another website called 
https://americanmonk.org .  Although I am not “The Only American Monk”, it was available and it is easy to remember, so I took it.  This website has been more active than withmetta so take a look.  Feel free to send me a story.  My email is bksubhuti and my server is gmail .  I think you can figure out how to type that out.

**Update: 2022**  I was going to shut down this website because it was inactive for such a long time.  However, I learned about free hosting from github.com.  This website is hosted for free on https://github.com/dhammacakka/withmetta

###  You Can Be The Next Writer !
I would like to again start accepting stories of loving-kindness.  If you have any stories please send them in.  The small simple stuff is what we would like to hear about.  Did you give some food away to someone in need, or lend a helping hand in some way?  If not, do so, and write about your experience.  If you were on the receiving end, we would also love to hear your stories!
