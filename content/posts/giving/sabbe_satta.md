# Sabbe Satta (metta)

When a Buddhist monk says “sabbe satta,” that is a shorthand for metta practice.
“Sabbe satta” means “all beings.”

One of my friend’s collects the leftover food and cakes and says or acts on this everyday after each meal at our monastery. But in reality, even though he says “sabbe satta,” he really just seems to feed the birds with the leftover food and cakes.
One day, I said to him, “So you are going to feed the birds?”
He said, “Sabbe Satta.”

He continued, “When we feed the birds, we feed all beings. This is because when the bellies of the birds are full, the other animals and insects can also eat their leftovers too. But when the bellies of the birds are full, the birds no longer look for worms and insects to eat. The worms and insects are free from danger. Every being can benefit.”

He confidently concluded his explanation again with the words, “Sabbe Satta.”

When we know the deep meaning of some small words, they can transform into big words. When we chant the loving-kindness practice chant, we start with “sabbe satta” and then go through a list of all the different beings, and then go through a list of the ten directions, and then we go through the four phrases. This is to bring to mind the loving kindness for “Sabbe Satta.”

Here is the loving-kindness chant below:
